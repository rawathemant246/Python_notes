# Strings 

## Type Hinting 

my_str : str

- String consist of single characters and are sequential data types.

- Due Sequential in nature  which is why many actions can be performed analogously, such as slicing.

- Python does not have a data type for inividual characters, so they are simply represented as string of length 1.

- Strings can be created as character sequences in double or single quotes, as shown by the following two lines:

`str1 = "DOUBLE QUOTED STRING"`
`str2 = 'SINGLE QUOTED STRING'`


## Most Common functions that are useful in practice

- **len(str)**: gets the length of the string. This is a general Python function for querying the length of sequential data types such as lists or tuples, etc., but also strings.


- **str[index]**: provides index-based access to individual letters.
- **str[start : end]/ str[start:end:step]**: extracts characters
